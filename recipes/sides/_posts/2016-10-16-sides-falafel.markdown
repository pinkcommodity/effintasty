read: This is a great recipe for meal prep, to eat on salads or in sandwiches for the work week. Traditionally, falafel is fried, but I prefer to bake it to keep things a bit lighter. I usually eat as a salad with only this and feta cheese. **This recipe is marked gluten-free, but please be sure to check your ingredients that they are marked "gluten-free" before you serve to anybody with dietary restrictions.

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Add onion and garlic to food processor and blend thoroughly. Scrape into separate bowl and set aside.
3. Add chickpeas, salt, cumin, parsley and cilantro to food processor and blend until thoroughly blended-but NOT a paste!
4. Add onion and garlic paste to chickpea mixture, blending thoroughly.
5. Add baking powder and 1 tablespoon flour to the chickpea and onion mixture, pulsing in the food processor until a dough starts to form. You're looking for a playdough-like consistency. Continue to add flour until you get the desired consistency.
6. Scrape dough into separate bowl, ensuring that all ingredients are thoroughly mixed from the corners of the food processing bowl.
7. Spray cookie sheet with cooking spray. **If you're going to fry your falafel, heat your oil.
8. Using a medium cookie scoop or spoon, place walnut-sized balls of dough onto the cookie sheet. Flatten each ball with a spoon or fork. **The falafel will barely expand when baking, so these disks can be pretty close to each other.
9. Bake for 40 minutes, allow to cool before serving.
