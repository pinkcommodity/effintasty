read: I absolutely love these green beans, they're exactly what I was looking for when I went searching for a "country" green bean recipe. I typically use frozen green beans, as they are general better quality than the fresh available to me, if you cook with fresh you'll need to add a few minutes to your cook time. The original recipe calls for black pepper, and even red pepper flakes, but I find that these aren't really the palate I'm looking for-add if you'd like to add some heat though! I usually only add butter if my bacon is a little light on bacon grease. Enough bacon grease is about a tbsp worth.

1. Cook bacon in medium-large pot until fully crisp. Remove bacon and set aside. 
2. Add remaing ingredients to pot with bacon grease, cover and bring to boil on high heat. 
3. Reduce heat to medium-low, leave covered and cook about 45 minutes or until green beans are preferred texture (if you're using fresh green beans, you will need to cook up to an additional 30 minutes).
4. Toss bacon in green beans, leaving a few aside to garnish. Serve immediately.
