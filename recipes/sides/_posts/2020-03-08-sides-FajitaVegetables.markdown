read: I use this recipe for my Chipotle copycat bowl-it's super easy! It works well when camping for our chicken tacos as well. It's important to remove from heat as soon as they're cooked through, as the veggies will continue to cook-and these veggies easily overcook! You can use yellow or red bell peppers, but they tend to be more sweet, which is not my preference.

1. Slice and core the green bell peppers, slice the red onions. 
2. Place 1/4 cup water in medium saucepan on medium-high heat. 
3. Once the water starts to boil, add onions and bell peppers. Cover and let cook until water has boiled off, about 2 min. 
4. Add salt and oregano, toss thoroughly, cover and let cook another 7-8 minutes-bell peppers are bright green when their ready, onions are looking translucent. 
5. Ensure veggies are just tender, remove from heat.
