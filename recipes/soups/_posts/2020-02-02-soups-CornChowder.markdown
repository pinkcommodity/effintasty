read: I halved this recipe from the original I found, it was simply too much and we often ended up throwing a good portion of it away. As I've written, this it easily has about 10 servings, so for me and Tyler that's still a few meals of leftovers.

1. Fry up your bacon chop and set aside.
2. Rinse your potato and dice into 1/2 inch pieces, leaving the skin on! Dice your onion.
3. Add your diced bacon, diced potatoes, corn, seasoned salt, diced onion, minced garlic, and chicken broth to your crockpot. Mix all ingredients together. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours. 
4. Remove cover and add the heavy whipping cream, mixing in thoroughly. Cook for 20 more minutes.
5. Blend with an immersion blender until you've reached your desired consistency.
