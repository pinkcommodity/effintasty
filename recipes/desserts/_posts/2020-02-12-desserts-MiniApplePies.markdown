read: This is one of my most requested desserts, and one of my easiest! It's super delicious, easy and doesn't require a pre-cook of the apple pie filling. I definitely recommend using cooked pie dough, rather than store bought-it tastes way better. The salted butter really brings out the apple flavor when it melts into the mixture. When taking out of the muffin tin, I find a paring knife works best-cut the baked-on juices to loosen the pie from the tin.

1. Peel and dice the apples into 1/2" pieces
2. In a large bowl, add the applie pieces, flour, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly so that the apple pieces are evenly coated. 
3. Spray your muffin tin with your spray oil
4. Roll out your pie dough and cut out ~4" circles. Place one circle in the bottom of each muffin mold, pressing slightly with your fingers. Do NOT through away the left over dough.
5. Fill each muffin mold with a large spoonful of apple mix. 
6. Cut butter stick into 24 pieces. I find it easiest to cut lengthwise into 4 long pieces, and then cut widthwise into 6 pieces. 
7. Place one piece of butter on each muffin mold.
8. Use the remaining pieces of dough to cover the muffin molds. You don't want total coverage of the dough so that the pies can vent while baking. 
9. Cook for 25 minutes, take out of the oven and allow to fully cool in the muffin pan.
