read: This is a basic recipe that will work with any type of cake you need to frost. Add the heavy cream carefully, for your desired consistency-I find that if you skip it entirely the frosting will be too thick for most purposes, but depending on the piping you plan, you may not need all of the heavy whipping cream. As with all white frostings, this dyes very well, but getting a very rich, dark color could require A LOT of dye.

1. Cream together the cream cheese and butter until smooth. Be sure to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl, AS WELL AS the bottom at least twice! 
2. Sift sugar and slowly add to butter mixture. When adding the sugar, make sure that your mixture isn't moving any faster than the lowest setting. Mix thoroughly.
3. Add vanilla, then add whipping cream until you've reached your desired consistency. 
4. Add food dye until desired color is reached.
