read: I recommend making your own pie dough, not store bought-it tastes way better and it's super easy to make! Fresh berries are best during the summer, so I tend to make this only during summertime unless someone instists. I usually use a combination of blackberry, raspberry and strawberry, but you should use your preference. This custard is such a cheat and I absolutely love it-none of the usual whisking over a double-boiler!

1. In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix together sugar, corn starch, and egg yolks. the mixture should be a pale yellow, thin paste. 
2. Cut your vanilla bean in half, and split down the middle, exposing the seeds. 
3. Add milk to a medium saucepan, and add your vanilla bean. Bring to a simmer over low heat-it's really important that you don't scorch your milk!
4. Remove the vanilla bean from the milk, and pour half of the milk mixture into the egg mixture-whisk thoroughly. This tempers your eggs so they don't scramble when you heat them up. 
5. Pour the egg/milk mixture into the remaining milk mixture, continuing to heat while whisking constantly. Continue cooking and whisking until mixture is slightly bubbling and has a pudding-like texture. It's really important to keep whisking or your custard will burn at the bottom of the pan, and the texture will be grainy.
6. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.
7. Cover custard with a piece of parchment paper-it's CRITICAL that the parchment paper makes full contact with your custard, so no skin forms while the custards cools. Press your parchment paper into your custard to accomplish this. 
8. Allow to cool fully, overnight in the refrigerator.  
9. Once your custard is fully cooled, grease your mini muffin pan and preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.
10. Roll out your pie dough, cut into 2" circles and line the bottom of a mini muffin pan, pressing down slightly with your fingers. If you press down firmly enough, you won't need to use pie weights. 
10. Bake for 14 minutes, until the pie crusts are a golden brown.
11. While your pie crusts are cooling, strain your cooled custard-DO NOT skip this step, your custard will be mealy without it! ALWAYS STRAIN YOUR CUSTARD.
12. Fill a piping bag with your custard, using a 1/4" opening or piping head. Pipe custard into pie shells-pie shells should be filled to the top of the shell.
13. Cut berries lengthwise into 1/2 or 1/4, depending on the berry. I usually do half for the raspberries and blackberries, 1/4 for strawberries, but as strawberry size can vary quite a lot, sometimes I cut into more pieces. You're going for presentation here, use your judgement. 
14. Arrange berries on top of the custard-filled pie shell, one piece of each berry per shell. I usually use 1/2 raspberry, 1/2 blackberry, and 1/4 strawberry, as in the picture.
