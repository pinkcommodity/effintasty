read: This is certainly a delicious recipe, but I actually favor it without the food dye when I can-it does nothing for the flavor is a bit of a turn-off for me. I recommend using Americolor food dye gel, rather than the more readily available McCormick food dye, as you only need about 1 tsp or so of Americolor dye-rather than 2 tablespoons of the McCormick (crap). I always make this with my cream cheese frosting, as that's the tradition. The original recipe called for shortening, which I never use-the butter and oil work well to deliver an absolutely light and delicious cake!

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour 2 9-inch cake round pans. If you only have one, be sure to THOROUGHLY clean the pan and then re-grease and flour. Your second will stick to the pan if you skip this step!
2. Cream together sugar, butter and oil until smooth. Add eggs and beat thoroughly.
3. Sift together dry ingredients (sugar, flour, salt, baking soda, and baker's cocoa) in a medium bowl and set aside.
4. Alternately add dry ingredients and buttermilk to the butter mixture, mixing together until just mixed-be careful not to overmix!
5. Add vanilla and food dye until the batter no longer looks marbled from the red food dye.
6. Add half the batter to each pan, and bake for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. 
7. Allow cakes to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and allow the cakes to cool completely. Frost cakes once fully cooled.
