ingredients:
- 48 Hershey's Milk Chocolate Kisses (you'll probably only NEED 30, eat the rest!)
- 1 3/4 cup sifted all-purpose flour (sift the flour first and then measure)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt (depends on the salt content of peanut butter)
- 4 oz. (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus 1 cup more to roll cookies in
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
- 3 to 4 tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 egg, grade large
servings: "about 30 cookies"
preptime: "20 minutes"
cooktime: "30 minutes"
read: These are the quintessential cookie for me, they're so cookie-like and glittery from the sugar, that they've always been one of my favorites. Super easy to make, the sugar is light in the batter due to the addition of the Kiss and the granulated sugar you roll the cookie in. DO NOT rush the cooling process! After adding the kiss, it will hold it's shape but is a couple degrees away from melting, so be sure not to touch until the cookies are fully cooled (I usually wait an hour to be safe)!

1. Preheat over to 350 degrees F, setting rack in center position. 
2. Unwrap Hershy's Kisses, set aside in a bowl.
3. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
4. In stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream together butter and peanut butter.
5. Add sugars and continue until fully mixed.
6. Add milk and vanilla extract until fully mixed.
7. Setting mixer to low, add 1/2 of the flour mixture until fully combined. 
8. Add egg to batter, continuing to mix. 
9. Add the last of the flour mixture, mixing until fully blended. If the dough is too dry (flaky like pie crust rather than a cohesive batter), add milk 1 tbsp at a time until the batter comes together. 
10. Place 1 cup of granulated sugar in a bowl or small plate. 
11. Pinch off walnut-sized pieces of dough (approximately 1-1.5 oz), roll into a ball, and then roll in the granulated sugar. Place on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Be sure not to place cookies too close togther as they spread significantly during baking.
12. Bake cookies for 11 to 13 minutes. The cookies will only lighten a bit and will be soft to the touch. 
13. Immediately place one Hershey's kiss in the center of each cookie, pushing down slightly to create a small cradle for the kiss in the dough. DO NOT touch again until fully cooled. 
14. Immediately transfer cookies to cooling rack via spatula.
