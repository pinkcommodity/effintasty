ingredients:
- 1 box butter cake mix
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) stick butter
- 1 egg
- 8 oz. cream cheese
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar, more for dusting
servings: 24 cookies
preptime: 2 hours, 15 min
cooktime: 12 minutes
read: This is NOT over 2 hours of active prep time, but the cookie dough must be refrigerated for at least 2 hours before you roll and bake. You can easily make the dough the night before you bake. The key with this dough is keeping it cold-the high content of butter makes it necessary. Personally, I like the taste of these cookies the day after they've been baked-they have a sort of Madeline quality to them. These cookies WILL NOT come out crispy-they are more like small cakes, so extending the cooking time only burns them-as does greasing your cookie sheet!

1. Allow your butter and cream cheese to soften only slightly.
2. Using the paddle attachment of your stand mixer, thoroughly cream the cream cheese, butter and vanilla extract together.
3. Add the cake mix and egg, mixing thoroughly.
4. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate AT LEAST 2 hours. It's key that you don't shorten this step, if the dough is too warm, it'll be tacky and difficult to roll. An easy test is to check your fingers-if your fingers are covered in dough, the dough is too warm and should be placed back in your fridge.
5. Once properly cooled, preheat your oven to 350 F degrees. Place powdered sugar in a small bowl.
6. Take your dough out of the fridge. Pinch off walnut-sized portions of dough, roll into balls and then cover in powdered sugar. Place ball on cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart-the dough has a pretty good spread as it cooks, so be sure to give your cookies enough room on the cookie sheet!
7. Bake for 12 minutes, or until a rich golden brown on the bottom.
8. Allow to cool on the pan. Dust with additional powdered sugar.
