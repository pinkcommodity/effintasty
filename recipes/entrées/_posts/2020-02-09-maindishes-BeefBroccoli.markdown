read: This is one of my favorite weeknight meals, that's pretty light and high in protein. I usually make at least a double-portion, as it re-heats really well and turns into an easy dinner for the rest of the week! An actual wok makes this recipe way easier, otherwise cooking the beef can take a while. I also usually use frozen broccoli, which can tend to overcook, so you may want to shorten that cooking step-or your broccoli will be on the VERY soft side. **If you intend this recipe to be gluten-free, be sure to select your ingredients, as the "gluten-free" type. This is especially important for soy sauce.**

1. In a small bowl, mix chicken broth, soy sauce, and sugar. Set aside.
2. Whisk together water and cornstarch. Set aside.
3. Heat a wok over high heat. Add oil and heat through. Swirl to coat pan. 
4. Add ginger and garlic, cooking until the smell is released-about 3 min. 
5. Add the beef to the wok, spreading the beef over the wok in a single layered. Continue tossing the beef in the oil mixture until the beef is cooked through. Cook 5-8 minutes, tossing every couple minutes.
6. Add broccoli and toss with beef, until broccoli is cooked through.
7. Add chicken stock mixture to wok, tossing to coat thoroughly. Reduce juices by at least half, about 6 min. 
8. Create a void in the center of the pan, add cornstarch mixture and toss thoroughly. Allow sauce to thicken, about 2 min. Serve immediately, garnish with toasted sesame seeds as desired.
