read: This recipe yields quite a lot of pasta, but it reheats really well so it's a great meal for the beginning of the week. I just use a basic chicken bake to dice and chop in the pasta, but whatever suits your preference is fine.

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place trimmed chicken in glass casserole dish, season as desired, bake for 25 minutes. Dice chicken and set aside.
2. While chicken is baking, add olive oil and butter to medium sized sauce pan on medium heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic and shallots. Sautee until shallots are translucent, about 4-5 minutes. 
3. Add vodka to garlic and shallots, and reduce about 1/2, this should take about 3 min.
4. Add chicken stock, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes to the vodka mixture, bring to a boil and reduce heat. Simmer for about 15 minutes.
5. Cook pasta to desired texture. Drain.
6. Add cream to sauce, stir in thoroughly. Once sauce starts bubbling again, remove from heat. 
7. Toss sauce, pasta and chicken together, chop basil and toss with pasta. Serve immediately.
