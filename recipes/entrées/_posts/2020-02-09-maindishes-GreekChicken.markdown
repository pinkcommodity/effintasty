read: This is probably my favorite chicken marinade, and it's sooo easy! I generally triple this recipe, as it's delicious for any pre-cooked chicken recipe, and also makes a great sandwich! Mostly, I make this with my spinach rice recipe.

1. Trim and prepare your chicken breasts, cutting at least 3 slits into each piece.
2. Add your olive oil, minced garlic, salt, pepper, paprika and lemon juice to a marinading container (such as a tupperware), whisk all together until thoroughly blended.
3. Add the chicken to the container, spooning the blended marinade into the slits of the chicken breasts, and submerge into the marinade-be sure that the chicken is covered by more than just olive oil. Let rest in the refrigerater overnight if possible, but at minimum 30 minutes.
4. Remove from the fridge. If you've refridgerated, let rest on the counter for at least 20 minutes. Grill your chicken (BBQ is best, but the chicken can be baked as well).
