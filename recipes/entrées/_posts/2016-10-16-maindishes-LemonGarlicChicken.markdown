read: This recipe is very garlicked up-we're a garlic household. The fresh garlic keeps the sharpness, the granulated intensifies the garlic flavor, and the salt brings a bit more depth. You can use this on chicken or a white fish (like tilapia), but it works better with chicken. This is a marinade, so the flavor if tested should be VERY strong-if you taste test, you're really just looking for balance, as your chicken will obviously not be as strongly flavored. **This recipe is marked gluten-free, but please be sure to check your ingredients (especially your soy sauce) that they are marked "gluten-free" before you serve to anybody with dietary restrictions.

1. Trim and prepare your chicken breasts, cutting at least 3 slits into each piece.
2. Add your olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, granulated garlic, garlic salt, and pepper to a marinading container (such as a tupperware), whisk all together until thoroughly blended.
3. Spoon the blended marinade into the slits of the chicken breasts, and submerge into the marinade-be sure that the chicken is covered by more than just olive oil. Let rest in the refrigerater overnight if possible, but at minimum 30 minutes.
4. Remove from the fridge, and grill your chicken (BBQ is best, but the chicken can be baked as well).
