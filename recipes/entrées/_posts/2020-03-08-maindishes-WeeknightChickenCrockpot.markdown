1. Place trimmed chicken breasts at the bottom of the crockpot.
2. Pour the chicken dressing evenly over the chicken.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the sour cream and cream of chicken soup. Spread evenly over the stove top. The gravy mixture will toss up the dressing, but that's fine-it'll cook just fine!
4. Cook on low for 4 hours. 
5. Once cooked, shred chicken, and thoroughly mix with dressing & gravy. Allow to cool a bit and serve!
