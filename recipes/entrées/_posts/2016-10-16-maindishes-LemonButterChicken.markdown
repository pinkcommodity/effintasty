read: Be careful when adding your chicken to your pan that the butter doesn't splatter-it burns! I usually serve this with pasta and a starchy vegetable, like brussels sprouts.

1. Prepare and trim your chicken breasts, cutting to cutlet-sized pieces (a little bit larger than tenders).
2. Heat your pan to medium-high, melting half of your butter (4 tablespoons) and allowing it to brown a bit.
3. While your pan heats, cover each cutlet with one coat of flour.
4. After your butter has browned a bit, add half of your lemon juice.
5. Place your chicken in the pan, allowing it to cook in the lemon butter for 10 minutes.
6. Take chicken out of pan, add the other half of the butter and lemon juice to the pan, allowing the butter to melt.
7. Once melted, add the chicken back to the pan, uncooked-side down. Allow to cook for an additional 10 minutes.
8. Once fully cooked, add chicken to serving dish, scraping the juices from the pan into the dish.
