read: This was a go-to favorite for my Aunt Cheri and me when I was growing up-it's just so easy! With only 3 ingredients, you can't go wrong when you make and the flavors are absolutely delicious. This pairs well with any side or veggie in my opinion, but I typically service with mashed potaties and brussels sprouts or broccoli. Cook time can vary dependent on your pork loin size, so make sure you get your loin up to 145 degrees F before pulling it out of the oven!

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Spread dijon mustard evenly all over the pork loin, including the ends.
3. Pour breadbrumbs onto a plate and roll mustard-loin to evenly coat. 
4. Place loin on foil-covered baking sheet (or roasting pan, if desired). Dust top with any extra bread crumbs.
5. Bake at 400 for 10 minutes.
6. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake for an additional 90 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F. 
7. Remove from oven and allow to rest for about 10 minutes before slicing up and serving, enjoy!
