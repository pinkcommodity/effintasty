read: I found this recipe to be off in terms of proportions, and a little light on the amount of chicken it called for. I typically make this recipe for my meal prep for the week, so I'm making up to 5 pounds of chicken at a time. This recipe covers about 2 pounds, but can very easily be doubled or tripled to accommodate more chicken.

1. Add all ingredients to a large tupperware container or mixing bowl with a lid.
2. Mix ingredients thoroughly, add chicken and toss to coat completely.
3. Refridgerate for 30 min to 24 hours, allowing chicken to rest for 20-30 minutes at room temperature prior to grilling.
4. Grill for about 20 minutes, until cooked thoroughly. Allow to rest at room temperature for about 10 minutes before cutting and/or serving.
