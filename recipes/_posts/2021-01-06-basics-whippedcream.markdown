read: I hesitate to call this a recipe, but it is my go-to for big gatherings when I make ice cream, cake and/or pie. It's way better than anything you can buy in the store, and can be made in advance. Generally this recipe makes double the amount of whipped cream that you add of heavy whipping cream (ie, 1 pint heavy whipping cream = 4 cups whipped cream) While I've certainly used my homemade whipped cream up to 3 days later (or maybe more), it's really best within 24 hours, but making it a day ahead can save a ton of time. I've also found that people are impressed when I make this, so it'll earn you extra kitchen-skill points with virtually no effort!

1. Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer, put towel over the top of the mixer, covering the top of bowl. Do not let your towel in the bowl or anywhere near the whisk attachment. 
2. Whisk on high for about 2-4 minutes, until cream stands a bit on its own when pushed with a spatula. It's key not to overbeat, as your mixture can turn to (very sweet) butter, or even have a mealy texture.
3. Refrigerate or serve immediately!
