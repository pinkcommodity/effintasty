read: This dish really isn't diet friendly, but it's still a favorite in our house because it's so delicous and easy. I usually serve with steamed broccoli lightly seasoned with garlic salt, it complements the dish really well. You can easily do one step at a time to focus a little more, as bacon grease can get a little unruly if not properly watched. My Blackened season doesn't have salt (which appears to be the standard), so I use salted butter, but whatever seasoning you use, keep this in mind or things could get salty!

1. Set pot of water to boil water for your pasta. Add spaghetti noodles when water boils, reducing heat to medium low. Cook to desired tenderness. Usually about 10-15 minutes based on preference.
2. Heat skillet (ideally cast iron) over medium-high heat, add bason when heated. 
3. Reduce heat to medium, cook bacon until crispy.
3. While your bacon cooks, combine parmesan cheese, eggs, salt (I usually use about 1/2-3/4 tsp) and pepper (I usually use about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp), using a fork to mix thoroughly. Set aside.
4. Remove bacon from pan onto towels to soak up grease, remove pan from heat and pour bacon grease into separate bowl for later use. 
5. Place pan back on heat, set heat to medium/medium-low, add 1 tbsp bacon grease. Immediately add minced garlic, cook for about 30 seconds and remove from heat. 
6. Add bacon bits, 1-2 tsps bacon grease, and cooked garlic to your egg & cheese mixture, mixing thoroughly with your fork. 
7. Cut your chicken breasts in half lengthenwise, to reduce thickness by about half. 
8. Melt butter in microwave about 30 seconds. 
9. Using a basting brush, brush melted butter over chicken breasts and then dust with blackened seasoning.
10. Return bacon pan to medium heat, add your chicken butter seasoned side down. Baste the unseasoned chicken side with remaining butter, dust with blackened seasoning. Cook thoroughly, about 4-5 minutes each side.
11. From you spaghetti pot, remove about 2 cups of pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta. 
12. Add about 1/2 cup of pasta water to egg & cheese mixture, mixing thoroughly. Add sauce to cooked spaghetti, tossing thoroughly-is the sauce needs to loosen up a bit, add more of the reserved pasta water-I would recommend adding no more than a quarter cup or even a few tablespoons at a time. 
13. Serve with cooked chicken, sliced and placed atop the pasta.
