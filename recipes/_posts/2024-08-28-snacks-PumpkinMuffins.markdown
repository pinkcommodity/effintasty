read: This is a dog-friendly recipe, but super delicious for humans too! You can sweeten with honey if you'd prefer, and use oat flour instead of AP, but my ingredients are listed based on what I usually have on hand. I make mine as mini-muffins, but you can make regular-sized muffins by baking for 22-27 min instead of the 10-15 specified in the recipe. This is not a cake but a mildly sweet muffin, and so popable it's dangerous!

1. Preheat over to 350 degrees F.
2. Combine all dry ingredients in medium bowl and whisk thoroughly. 
3. Combine all wet ingredients in large bowl and whisk thoroughly. 
4. Gradually spoon dry ingredients into wet ingredients until fully incorporated. 
5. Fully grease your mini-muffin pan.
6. Fill each muffin mold about 2/3 full. 
7. Bake for 10-15 min, turning halfway through. 
8. Confirm doneness by inserting a toothpick and seeing if it comes out clean. 
9. Allow to cool on a wire rack. Once fully cooled, remove muffins from their tin.
