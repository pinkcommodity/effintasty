read: If you prefer, you can use rotisserie chicken - I personally don't like it (I think I'm the only one!), so I usually just trim and bake my chicken with salt and pepper, then shred it. I'm usually a tortilla snob, preferring to make my own, or at least using the uncooked flour tortillas, the flavor and texture is just so much better, but in this recipe it's not necessary, the basic store bought doesn't impact flavor. Be CAREFUL with how much Red Hot you put in your dish, it does NOT cook off!

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 
2. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce, setting aside.
3. Combine shredded chicken, enchilada sauce, shredded cheese and Frank's Red Hot into a medium bowl, mixing thoroughly. 
4. Grease a casserole dish with a light coating of vegetable oil. 
5. Take one tortilla and fill with cheese & chicken mixture, using about 1/8 of the filling, close tortilla around filling, placing seam side DOWN into the casserole dish (you want the enchildada to be closed). Repeat until casserole dish is full. 
6. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over enchiladas, making sure all tortillas are wet - use a spatula to spread as needed. 
7. Dust dish with remain cheese. 
8. Place in oven for 25 minutes.
