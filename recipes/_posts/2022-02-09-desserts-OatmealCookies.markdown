read: Oatmeal cookies are my favorite, I think because my grandmother always had them stashed in cookie jars around her house. While hers were crunchy (and store bought), these are chewy and great. You'll want to remove from the cookie sheet as soon as possible, so that they don't continue to bake on the sheet, but otherwise this recipe is VERY easy and sure to please!

2. Mix together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment.
3. Add 1 egg at a time, then vanilla. Mix thoroughly. 
4. Add oats and raisins, mixing thoroughly. 
5. Pinch off walnut-sized pieces (about 2 oz.), roll into balls and place on cookie sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. 
6. Bake 13 minutes, until edges are golden.
