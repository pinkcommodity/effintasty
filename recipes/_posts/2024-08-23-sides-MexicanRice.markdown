read: Since the water content on the tomato and onion can vary, watch the liquid you add to your rice, you may need a bit more to make sure the rice cooks properly and is nice and fluffy.

1. Add olive oil to medium saucepan, heat on medium heat.
2. Add rice to oil and toast until lightly browned. You'll need to let is rest a little longer than you'd expect, but don't forget it because it goes from perfectly browned to thoroughly burnt in the blink of an eye!
3. While your rice is toasting, Add tomatoes (cut in half), onion (cut in fourths), 1 cup chicken broth, garlic and salt to blender. Blend thoroughly.
4. Added blender contents to rice, add rest of chicken broth and reduce heat to low. Cover rice and cook for 25 minutes.
5. Once cooked, fluff rice and serve.
