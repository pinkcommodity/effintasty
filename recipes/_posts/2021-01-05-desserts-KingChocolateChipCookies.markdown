read: I love chocolate chip cookies, and so does Tyler-really. These are the only cookies he will eat, and designates these cookies "King" while the rest are "Peasant" cookies, hence the name. I've always just made whatever the recipe on the bag of chocolate chips said, but they were never quite right. I've fancified them with ground oats, and it still wasn't quite right. I've learned there are a few tricks-both in the ingredients AND the prep that have the desired impact for rounded, beautiful, DELICIOUS chocolate chip cookies. Enjoy!

1. Preheat oven 375 degrees F. 
2. Using a stand or electric mixer, cream together your softened butter and sugars (granulated and brown). Blend until they are just smooth. Don't overmix.
3. Add eggs and vanilla extract, mix on medium until combined with butter/sugar. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
4. Add baking soda and salt, mix on medium until combined with egg & sugar mixture. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
5. Slowly add flour, about a half a cup at a time, until fully incorporated. After 1 and 2 cups are added, scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula. After all flour has been added, scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula and mix for 20 more seconds. 
6. Using a spatula, mix in chocolate chips (and nuts, if using) until evenly distributed in the dough. 
7. Using a kitchen scale, piece out 1 oz. of dough at a time, roll into a ball and place onto a greased cookie sheet. While this isn't critical, it does make for the most even cookies, and the spread of the cookie when baking is reduced if you roll it into a ball. 
8. Bake for 13 minutes. You can reduce to 11 minutes for chewier cookies, or increase to 15 if you like crispier cookies.
9. Immediately remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack, and enjoy!
