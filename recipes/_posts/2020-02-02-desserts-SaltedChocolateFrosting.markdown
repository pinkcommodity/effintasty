read: This is my absolute favorite-and my most requested-chocolate frosting recipe. This definitely has an intense flavor because of the salted butter, but it is DELICIOUS. Because of it's intensity, I never use this on chocolate cake, something more mild is needed to pair with more chocolate. As written, this recipe produces a stiff frosting for frosting a cake or cupcakes, but would need a bit more sugar if you plan to do an detailed piping work.

1. Add butter, sugar, cocoa, whipping cream and vanilla extract to stand mixer and mix thoroughly, stopping at least twice to scrape the sides AND the bottom of the bowl.
2. Add either more sugar (to stiffen) or more whipping cream (to loosen) your frosting for desired consistency.
