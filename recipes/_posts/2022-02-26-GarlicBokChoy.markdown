read: I could probably live off of the dish, it was absolutely my favorite when I was living in Asia. This recipe is doubled from the original I was working off of - if you double further, you'll need a pretty large pot to hold all of the bok choy when it first goes into the pot. I generally serve with chicken fried rice, but this dish can stand alone as well! Do NOT cut the sugar, it doesn't add sweetness, it cuts the bitterness of the bok choy (and balances with the salt)! Lastly, my original recipe called for the bok choy to be quartered as well as trimmed, but this reduced the crunch and didn't look as appetizign to me, so I only trim the ends, but if you're looking for smaller bites, go ahead and quarter!

1. Trim ends from bok choy, about 1-2 inches from bottom of bulb. Quarter if desired.
2. Add oil to medium pot, heat over medium-high heat - the oil will appear to shimmer. 
3. Add garlic, ginger and salt to oil, reduce eat to medium, and mix together. 
4. Immediately add bok choy, mixing to coat with oil mixture. 
5. Cover and allow to cook down about 3-4 minutes. The bok choy will noticeably cook down and because a vivid green. 
6. Add water and sugar, mixing thoroughly. Cover and cook 2 additional minutes. 
7. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
