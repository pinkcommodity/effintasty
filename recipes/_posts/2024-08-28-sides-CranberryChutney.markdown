read: You definitely want to make this at least a day ahead since you want to serve it could. This is not for everybody, but I love just a bit with my turkey! The servings are admittedly small, but typically people don't want a ton.

1. Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil. (BOILING SUGAR IS EXTREMELY HOT, BE CAREFUL) 
2. Dice, seed and blend your whole orange (peel too, the bitterness is important)!
3. Peel and slice ginger into VERY thin slices.
4. Add blended orange and ginger slices to sugar water, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered for 20 min.
5.  Add cranberries, cinnamon, and cloves to pot, cook another 20 minutes until thickened - you're shooting for jam consistency, this should not at all be juicy. 
6. Put in refridgerator to cool, can be made up to a week in advance.
