read: I generally make this in two parts, where I make half of the beans with half of the bacon when I finish them in the crockpot. The bacon instantly heats the cold beans, and making a full batch for just the two of us can be a little too much. This is all about taste, so manage your salt, bacon and garlic to preference. Overnight prep is needed, but minimal time is needed so this is super easy to do during the week.

1. Add dry beans to a bowl and fill with water, water should be about an inch about the level of the beans. Cover and set aside overnight.
2. Drain beans, add to crock pot. Fill bowl with water and add to crock pot, you should have enough water to fully cover the beans. 
3. Add salt and garlic to crockpot, stir a few times with a spoon. Set on HIGH. Leave for 6 hrs, stirring once or twice while cooking.
4. Remove beans from water, but DO NOT TOSS THE WATER. Add about a half cup of the reserve water, blen using an immersion blender. Add more water as needed to get desired consistency (it will tighten up a bit when you add to the bacon). 
5. Dice bacon to smalls pieces. Cook in large skillet.
6. Once bacon is cooked, add blended beans to skillet. 
7. Add garlic salt and stir a few times using a spatula.
8. Reduce heat immediately, ensuring the bacon grease is fully mixed into the beans. Sprinkle cheese on top. 
9. Allow cheese to melt, serve in skillet.
