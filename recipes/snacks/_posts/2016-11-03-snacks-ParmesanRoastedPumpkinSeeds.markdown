read: Roasting pumpkin seeds is a new occupation for me, but boy are they delicious! The key is not to burn them, and be careful with salt-you can always add more later! **This recipe is marked gluten-free, but please be sure to check your ingredients (especially your soy sauce) that they are marked "gluten-free" before you serve to anybody with dietary restrictions.
