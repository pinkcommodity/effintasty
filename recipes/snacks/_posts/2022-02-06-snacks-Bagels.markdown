read: "I put off making bagels FOREVER because I thought they'd be super difficult, but they're actually pretty easy, especially when you get a feel for it (it took me 2-3 tries to be confident in what I was doing). I subbed agave from the original recipe which calls for honey, because I always have agave on hand, and it seems to have no impact on flavor or bagel quality. This recipe does not call for proofing your yeast, but I did that the first couple times, just for peace of mind. To proof your yeast, set asside about half a cup of water and add yeast, then add to dry ingredients once your yeast 'fizzes' and becomes foamy. FINAL NOTE: This can be a bit tough on your stand mixer, and if needed, you can finish your dough by kneading on a counter once ingredients come together."

1. Combine water and agave, stirring until agave is dissolved. Set aside.
2. Add bread flour, salt, and yeast into bowl of stand mixer with dough attachment.
3. Mix dry ingredients with your dough hook until combined, then, leaving the stand mixer on, slowly add your water agave mixture. 
4. Once the mixture is fully combined, and looking more dough-like than floury, increase speed to medium-low and knead the dough for about 3 minutes more, or until the dough has a nice elastic quality (to test, take a solid pinch of dough and pull away from the dough mass, and see if the pinch springs back into the mass).
5. Set in an oiled bowl, cover with oiled plastic wrap or a wet towel and allow to rise to about double size, at least 2 hours. Allow more time if needed. 
6. Once your dough has risen, prepare 2 cookie sheets cover in parchment or silicone mats. 
7. Time to form your bagels! Grab a section of dough (I usually go for 4 oz. each), forming them into bagels shapes. I find this easiest when rolling the dough into a ball, flattening into a think disk, and then ripping a hole in the center, which I then smooth out through some quick modeling. 
8. Place bagels about 1/2-1 inch apart on cookie sheet, covering with plastic wrap. Place in refrigerator overnight. 
9. Remove bagels from fridge, allow to rest/continue rising for about 30 minutes. To confirm your bagels are ready, fill a bowl with cold water, and place your bagel in the water. If the bagel floats, you're ready! 
10. Preheat oven to 500 Degrees F. 
11. Fill pot with water, add baking soda. Bring to rapid boil. 
12. Add bagels to pot, boiling for 1 min on each side, return to pan, season with desired bagel seasoning.
13. Place bagels in over after seasoning, 12 minutes or until bottom of bagel is golden brown. 
14. Allow to cool. Store in refrigerator, microwaving for 30 seconds before toasting, and they'll stay super fresh!
