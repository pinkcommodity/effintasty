read: This is a pretty easy recipe, but be careful that you don't add too many dumplings to the broth in one drop-this can create pockets of flour when it comes time to eat. For chicken, rotisserie is a popular choice.

1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and baking powder mixing together thoroughly. 
2. Cut butter into small chunks and cut into flour mixture using a fork or (easier) a dough blender. You shouldn't see chunks of butter in your flour mixture-it should be thoroughly cut in. **NOTE: A dough-blender makes a world of difference here, it's worth the investment.**
3. Add milk, stirring in with a fork until dough comes together. Dough will be slightly tacky.
4. Heavily flour a work surface, scraping your dough onto the floured surface. 
5. Roll out dough, flouring heavily, to about 1/8-1/4" thickness. 
6. Using a pizza cutter or paring knife, cut dough into ~2"x2" squares. This doesn't have to be precise. Don't re-roll the dough to get the squares even. 
7. Boil chicken broth in large soup pot. You're looking for a strong boil, once achieved reduce heat to medium. 
8. Flour plate and using a spatula add a SINGLE LAYER of dumplings to the plate. 
9. Carefully place dumplings individually, and all flour on plate, into boiling chicken broth. 
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 until all dumplings are boiling. 
11. Boil dumplings for about 15 minutes. 
12. Add cooked chicken to pot, cook altogether about 5 min.
