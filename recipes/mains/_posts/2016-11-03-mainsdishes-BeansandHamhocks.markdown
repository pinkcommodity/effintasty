<b><em>READ THIS FIRST: This is a super-hearty weeknight meal that my mom used to make when I was little. I usually just let the hamhocks cook into the beans, and take them out whole when the beans are done. I like these best with served with fresh mix-ins: diced tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, diced onions, and fresh cilantro. **This recipe is marked gluten-free, but please be sure to check your ingredients (especially your soy sauce) that they are marked "gluten-free" before you serve to anybody with dietary restrictions.</em></b>

1. Place hamhock into crock-pot.
2. Put dried pinto beans into crock-pot. 
3. Add seasoning to crock-pot, covering evenly the top of the beans and hamhock.
4. Add water to crock-pot, giving everything a thorough mix.
5. Cover crock-pot and cook on HIGH for 5 hours. 
6. Serve beans with fresh mix-ins or eat plain. Feel free to shred and mix in the hamhock meat as well!
