read: This is a super-hearty weeknight meal that my mom used to make. I usually just let the hamhocks cook into the beans, and take them out whole when the beans are done. I like these best when served with fresh mix-ins such as diced tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, diced onions, and fresh cilantro. **This recipe is marked gluten-free, but please be sure to check your ingredients that they are marked "gluten-free" before you serve to anybody with dietary restrictions.
