read: The cloves make this recipe a bit more rich than normal, but it perfectly complements the tomato and garlic flavoring. This makes a large amount of spaghetti, and this reheats really well, so it's great for an early week night meal. The butter deepens the flavor, but if you want an easy way to reduce some fat, it doesn't have a MAJOR impact on flavor.
