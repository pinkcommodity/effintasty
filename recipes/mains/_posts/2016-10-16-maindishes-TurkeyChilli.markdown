read: This is my go-to lunchtime meal during the week, and super delicious. I usually eat one serving with 1/2 cup of white rice, and 1/2 cup of black beans. If you individually store your leftover servings, it's easier to reheat for each lunch! **This recipe is marked gluten-free, but please be sure to check your ingredients (especially your soy sauce) that they are marked "gluten-free" before you serve to anybody with dietary restrictions.
