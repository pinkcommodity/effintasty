read: I reduced the chilli proportion from the original recipe, as I like a balance between the mac and the chilli. Also, when adding your chilli to your mac use a slotted spoon or similar, as you don't want to add all the chilli juices and make this dish runny. The chilli recipe is pretty legit on its own, so if you're ever in the mood for some delicious chilli, this recipe would work as well!
