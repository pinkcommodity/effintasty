<b><em>READ THIS FIRST: The nutmeg and allspice make this a bit unusual and rich for a spaghetti sauce, but it's so delicious and rich! This reheats really well, so I'll even make double to save time on dinner prep for the week. Any pasta can be used, I just buy and like the whole wheat spaghetti.  </em></b>

1. Boil spaghetti noodles until desired tenderness, about 15 minutes. I prefer my noodles on the soft side, not al-dente.
2. Add the ground beef to a hot pan, cooking at medium heat until brown (cook with a wooden spatula to break up the meet, ensuring doneness).
3. Add [tomato], butter, garlic, garlic salt, nutmeg and allspice to the cooked meat, bring to a boil.
4. Reduce heat to simmer for 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to comingle. 
5. Add cooked, strained pasta to the meat sauce, coating pasta evenly with sauce. Served topped with parmesan, with additional parmesan on the side.
