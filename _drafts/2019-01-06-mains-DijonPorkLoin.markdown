<b><em>READ THIS FIRST:  </em></b>
This is a tasty recipe that I've worked on for quite a while. 

1. Trim and prepare your chicken breasts, cutting at least 3 slits into each piece.
2. Add your olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, granulated garlic, garlic salt, and pepper to a marinading container (such as a tupperware), whisk all together until thoroughly blended.
3. Spoon the blended marinade into the slits of the chicken breasts, and submerge into the marinade-be sure that the chicken is covered by more than just olive oil. Let rest in the refrigerater overnight if possible, but at minimum 30 minutes.
4. Remove from the fridge, and grill your chicken (BBQ is best, but the chicken can be baked as well).
