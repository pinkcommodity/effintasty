1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Trim your asparagus by cutting off the super fibrous, white ends of the asparagus stalks.
3. Place your trimmed stalks on a lipped cookie sheet (there needs to be a bit of a wall to ensure the oil doesn't drip off during cooking). 
4. Add the olive oil, salt and pepper to the stalks, rubbing them down to coat fully and evenly. 
5. Add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the oiled asparagus stalks, trying to coat as evenly as possible. The parmesan will tend to drift to the bottom of the pan, so be sure to scoop that up and place on the stalks before you finish. 
6. Lay out evenly on the pan, and sprinkle one last handful over the top of the asparagus.
7. Roast in the oven for 20 min, or until stalks are tender with a bit of chew (al dente).
