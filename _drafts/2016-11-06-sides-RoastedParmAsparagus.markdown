<b><em>READ THIS FIRST: This is my go-to potato dish for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, etc. I always win rave reviews for my super delicious, super creamy potatoes. This is a great make-ahead side, as you can prepare the casserole dish up to 3 days before you bake. Also be aware that Costco potatoes are supersized, so you may need fewer than the called for 7 (more like 4). It is easiest to mix this with a hand electric mixer, rather than a stand mixer. **This recipe is marked gluten-free, but please be sure to check your ingredients (especially your soy sauce) that they are marked "gluten-free" before you serve to anybody with dietary restrictions. </em></b>

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. **Only do this if you are going to eat the same day you prepare the casserole dish.
2. Peel and cut your potatoes into 2-inch pieces. Place into a pot, filling with water to 1-inch about the potatoes.
3. Bring water to a boil, reduce heat to medium and boil for [20 minutes], or until tender. 
4. While your potatoes are boiling, beat the sour cream and cream cheese together in a very large bowl.
5. When the potatoes are ready, drain and add them to the sour cream mixture until smooth. 
6. Add the butter, salt and pepper. Adjust to taste. I have been known to add both more butter and sour cream, depending on how I'm feeling that day. I really go for broke on Thanksgiving.
7. Rub the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter all over the bottom and sides of your casserole dish. Once coated with butter, use the first 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese on the bottom of the dish, using the butter to adhere the cheese. **I would recommend a more shallow casserole dish here, the deeper your dish, the lower your potato-to-delicious-parmesan-crust ratio will be. 
8. Top the casserole dish with the last of the parmesan cheese. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. **Or, skip to the baking step!
9. Bake for 35 minutes at 350 degrees F. **If your casserole is already at room temperature, you only need to bake for 25 minutes.
